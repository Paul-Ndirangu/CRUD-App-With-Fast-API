## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Fast API requires Python 3.6 and up.

Once you have Python installed, Fast API can be installed with a simple pip command

```
pip install fastapi
```

We will use pydantic to design our data scheme and simply pass in an object that will specify the data needed. This will make things much cleaner.
```
pip install pydantic
```
